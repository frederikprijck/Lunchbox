# Lunchbox

Lunchbox is a recipe management web-based application built in ReactJS and ASP.Net Core, on top of a Postgresql database accesed via Entity Framework. 
It is a hobby project in an attempt to broaden my knowledge of ASP.Net Core and Entity Framework; and to learn ReactJS as an alternative front-end solution to Angular.

Development on Lunchbox happens in my spare time, so don't expect large changes coming quick.
